# How to organise this folder

This lessons/ folder should contain git repositories of lessons that you would like to develop.

You can either run the example commands below:

- outside the docker container (on your local system) - *recommended*
- within the docker container via the RStudio Tools -> Terminal -> New Terminal

## Example

```bash
cd lessons
git clone git@github.com:swcarpentry/git-novice.git
```
